Android application made using java
This is an java based project for an NGO.
there are 3 files containing Java, res & gradle files
First copy all the java files inside the java folder to your project's exact same location from where you copy the files.
next copy the entire "res" folder to your project's same location and replace the entire folder.
Next step is copying the data from "AndroidManifest.xml" file to your manifest file.
Run the code.
Happy debugging ; )
